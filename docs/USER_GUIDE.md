   - **Sex**: Male or Female
   - **Chest Pain Type**: Select from the available options
   - **Resting Blood Pressure**: Measured in mm Hg
   - **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
   - **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Whether it's greater than 120 mg/dl
   - **Resting ECG Results**: Results of electrocardiogram
   - **Maximum Heart Rate**: Achieved during exercise
   - **Exercise Induced Angina**: Chest pain during exercise
   - **ST Depression**: Induced by exercise relative to rest
   - **Slope**: Of the peak exercise ST segment
   - **Major Vessels**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
   - **Thalassemia**: A blood disorder

3. Click "Predict" to submit your data
4. Wait for the system to process your information
5. View your results on the next screen

## FAQ

### Is this system accurate?
The system uses machine learning models trained on medical data and achieves over 90% accuracy. However, it's not 100% accurate and should not replace professional medical diagnosis.

### Is my data stored or shared?
No. Your medical data is processed only for prediction and is not stored or shared with any third parties.

### Can I use this instead of seeing a doctor?
No. This system is for educational purposes only. Always consult with a healthcare provider for medical concerns.

### What should I do if I get a high-risk result?
If you receive a high-risk result, consult with a healthcare provider as soon as possible for proper evaluation and care.

### How often should I use this system?
You can use the system as often as you like, especially if your medical conditions change.

## Troubleshooting

### The prediction is taking too long
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page and try again
- Ensure all required fields are filled correctly

### I'm getting an error message
- Verify all fields are filled with valid values
- Check that numerical values are within the specified ranges
